## Configuration

New animals are added in the `animals.json`. Add their name, life expectancy, and image link.

## Sources

Wikipedia was used for average life expectancy. Originally I was going to make this game use species population, but life expectancy is easier to verify and fact-check.

Images are from the first results of google images.

## Run locally

Clone this repository, then
